Disclaimer:

This project is for educational and research purposes only. Bypassing User Account Control (UAC) is a security risk, and its use should be limited to legal and ethical scenarios, such as testing or improving security systems. Unauthorized use or malicious intent could result in legal consequences. By using this project, you agree that the creator(s) take no responsibility for any misuse or damage caused by this code.

**Description**:

This Python script demonstrates a method for bypassing Windows UAC (User Account Control). UAC is a security feature designed to prevent unauthorized changes to a system. The project explores how UAC mechanisms work and how they can be bypassed under certain conditions.

Features:

Elevates privileges without triggering UAC prompts
Can be used for testing security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment
Demonstrates a known UAC bypass technique for learning and research purposes


How It Works:
The script leverages a known vulnerability in Windows to bypass the UAC prompt and execute commands with elevated privileges. It uses Python's native libraries and external system calls to achieve this.

Note: The method used in this script is for specific versions of Windows. It may not work on fully patched or updated systems, as the vulnerability may have been fixed in newer versions.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Windows operating system (certain versions with vulnerable UAC mechanisms)



How to run:

Run main.py
It should try to run letmein.py in cmd. 


After running the script, it will execute a command with elevated privileges without showing a UAC prompt. Ensure that you have proper permissions to test this in a controlled environment.



Limitations:
The script may not work on the latest versions of Windows, as UAC bypass vulnerabilities are typically patched quickly by Microsoft.
This project should not be used in production environments or on systems where you do not have permission to perform security tests.

Legal and Ethical Use:
This project is intended for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and developers who are interested in learning about potential security vulnerabilities. It is not designed or intended for malicious use. Make sure to follow all applicable laws and ethical guidelines when using this project.
